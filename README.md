WorLd
=====

Overview
--------

WorLd is a very simple 2D video game intendeed to be such as finnishing a level is equivalent to prove a mathematical assertion.

The precise form of the game is still undefined, but the gameplay is based on a 1D world, the *Word* (I first though the game will be named wor(l)d but parenthesis are not very practical) in which buildings represent already prooved theorems.


Installation
------------

For now, WorLd is a very tiny curses application, so its only dependency is `ncurses`.

Juste type then `make` to build and run the game !
